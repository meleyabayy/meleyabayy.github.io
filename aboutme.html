							<h2>How did I get here?</h2>
							
							<p class="major">My name is Meley Abay, and I am currently an incoming Junior, majoring in Computer Science and Engineering. My journey to the United States began three years ago when I moved from Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, due to the tragic genocide targeting my ethnic group, the Tigrayans. Leaving my home under such dire circumstances was incredibly challenging, but it was a necessary step to ensure the safety of my family and me.

<br> <br>Upon arriving in the U.S., I settled in Roseville, California, where I resumed my high school education. The transition was a significant change, but it allowed me to focus on my studies without the constant threat and discrimination I faced back in Ethiopia. After graduating high school, I chose to attend the University of California, Merced, due to the generous financial aid I received.

<br><br>In Ethiopia, my parents were highly accomplished professionals—my mother was the Head of Nurses, and my father ran an electrical company. However, their qualifications were not recognized here, and they had to re-earn their certifications and degrees. Witnessing their struggle and determination to rebuild their careers while ensuring my sister and I could pursue our education has been both heartbreaking and inspiring.

<br> <br>Despite these challenges, I feel privileged to have access to food, housing, clothing, and the opportunity to pursue my degree—luxuries that many from my community do not have. This sense of privilege fuels my passion for making a difference.

<br><br>In college, I found myself in environments where people who looked like me were a small minority. This inspired me to join organizations and initiatives dedicated to uniting and empowering students who share similar backgrounds. I am actively involved in creating supportive communities for underrepresented groups, ensuring that everyone has the opportunity to succeed and feel included.


<br><br> <h2>Why CSE?</h2>
<p class="major">I am interested in pursuing a degree in Computer Science and Engineering for a multitude of reasons. Firstly, I am driven to decrease bias and increase representation in a field where only 2% of black women are present. Secondly, my experiences during the war in Tigray showed me how technology can save lives. With the region under siege and cut off from the internet and outside communication, satellite imaging played a crucial role in revealing the truth about the genocide and providing guidance to the international community. This powerful demonstration of technology's impact solidified my desire to be part of a field that can drive such significant change.
<br><br>Thank you for taking the time to learn about my journey and aspirations.</p>
